I first went to github.com and created a new repository by clicking the + symbol

then i launched terminals and then entered this command
git clone git@github.com:nerdlker/odin-recipes.git

what this did was clone the github folder into the folder i was in.
Then i created this README.md by cd-ing into this folder and then typing touch README.md

https://nerdlker.github.io/odin-recipes/
