<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
  I saw this bacon sushi idea online somewhere, but I did not save it, so I had
  to wing it from memory and kept it as simple as possible. I made it for the
  March Madness final and the whole family loved it! I made it in the toaster
  oven on convection at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and kept a close eye on
  it.

<h3>ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 pound bacon slices</li>
  <li>1 pound ground chicken</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon barbeque chicken seasoning</li>
  <li>3 slices Havarti cheese</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Measure out a 20-inch square
    piece of parchment paper on a baking sheet.
  </li>
  <li>
    Lay out slices of bacon side-by-side, overlapping slightly, to create an
    even layer on the parchment paper.
  </li>
  <li>
    Combine ground chicken with barbeque seasoning; spread evenly onto the bacon
    layer from edge to edge. Place Havarti cheese slices lengthwise on top. Lift
    the parchment paper to help you roll a log, starting with the edge of bacon
    closest to you.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bake in the preheated oven, rotating baking sheet every 15 minutes, until
    bacon is crispy and chicken is cooked through; an instant-read thermometer
    inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C),
    about 1 hour.
  </li>
  <li>
    Remove from oven and cool until easily handled, about 15 minutes. Slice into
    bite-sized "sushi".
  </li>
</ul>
